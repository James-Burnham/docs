This guide helps learners and candidates navigating and getting acquainted with the Skillable Labs user interface. The Lab User Interface is Skillable's client to deliver labs, gives access to lab manual, and provides the hands-on, real-world, scenario-based training environments.


## Overview of the Lab Interface 

### Getting Started
In general, when a learner or candidate launches a lab, the Lab interface is displayed in two different configurations, depending on the lab components used when the lab was built:

- Virtualization based labs are displayed in a single browser window.

- Some Cloud-based labs may be displayed in two browser windows.

## Lab Interface Layout
The main window of Skillable Labs is split in two. On the left is the training real-world learning environment (e.g., a virtual machine), and on the right is the lab manual, which is a set of instructions, scenarios, and activities relating to the skills' training environment.
