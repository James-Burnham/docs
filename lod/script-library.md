The Script Library is a hub for script templates used in Activity Based Assessments (ABA) and Life Cycle Actions (LCA), facilitating script creation and maintenance across multiple labs. It standardizes the scripting process, reduces overhead, and fosters collaboration by enabling script sharing. The library's templates can be utilized as-is or as a foundation for creating ABA and LCA scripts.

## Overview of Script Library
The Script Library is a repository of script templates that can be used in Activity Based Assessments (ABA) or Life Cycle Actions (LCA). These scripts can be used as they are, or they can serve as a starting point to expedite the creation of ABA and LCA scripts.  The Script Library is the best place to store scripts as templates that you can tag with metadata to be easily searched for and used in other ABA or LCA scripts.  Gone are the days of copy and paste between Lab profiles.  The most challenging was to try and remember where a certain script was used and in which Lab profile, making the effort more tiresome and not able to scale well.  Now with Script Library this is entirely eliminated with a way to centralize the scripts into a Library of Templates that can be referenced easily.

## Best Practices
* Always make sure that you provide meaningful Script Template Names and utilize Keywords to allow easier searching of related Script Templates.
* Remember to leverage the Markdown formatting when writing the **How to Use this Script** as this will provide the necessary detail for successful adoption and utilization of Script Templates.
* It is best that Script Template Names are unique to make it more recognizable when searching.
* The best way for an Organization to keep the Script Library organized is to have the Lab Administrator be the one responsible for managing the templates, with the permissions to Create/Edit/Delete script templates.  All Lab Developers will have read access to the Script Library to be able choose a script template from the Script Library to insert into their lab LCA or ABAs.

## Required Permissions
This Script Library feature requires the following permissions. If you do not have these permissions, please reach out to our [customer support team](http://www.skillable.com/customer-support/) for assistance. 

| Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Viewing (by organization)   | Allows a Lab Developer or Lab Administrator to view library scripts that belong to organizations they manage. |
| Creating (by organization) | Allows a Lab Administrator to create library scripts within organizations they manage. |
| Editing (by organization) | Allows a Lab Administrator to edit library scripts for organizations they manage. |
|Deleting (by organization) | Allows a Lab Administrator to delete library scripts belonging to organizations they manage. |

## Accessing the Script Library
Script Library can be accessed from within ABA, LCA or from the Admin page.  If the user has the appropriate viewing permissions then a **Choose from Script Library** will be visible within the ABA, LCA script panel.  On the **Admin** page the user will see the **Script Library** tile.  Once the user selects one of these buttons they will be presented with the **Choose a Script Template** list view where they can then filter and choose the appropriate Script Template to use.
